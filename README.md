### MIT Deep Learning Tutorial

#### Topics this tutorial wants show

- Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN's)

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's)

#### My enviromment:

- Ubuntu 20.04

- Python 3.8

To run this tutorial, first  download the repo:

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
```

Them, follow the steps to make a virtual environment and install our dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, you can run the part_1, and see the output on terminal.

```bash
# note that inside venv, we call 'python', not 'python3'
python part_1.py 
```
The part_2.py only will work on jupyter notebook, but I keep the python file because (for me) is easier to debug.


Any doubts, you can contact me and I'll try help as faster  as possible.
